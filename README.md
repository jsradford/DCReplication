# DCReplication
Code and data to replicate my study of the emergence of gender discrimination on DonorsChoose. This is also on Dataverse
but will not be published until the paper is in press.

## Usages
The code and data can be used to create the output I use in papers. I'm trying to find the original codes I used 
to format the raw data and generate the intermediary data sets like the repeat donors data.
